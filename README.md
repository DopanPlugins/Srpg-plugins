IMPORTENT Info about the newest edited core Version:

needed IMGs are attached at this github

-has eventpriority change ,that requires the plugin "EventResetAfterAction",
in order to reset priority after each action..

-has an correctly working MapBattle PreAction Phase, that requires an Common Event
which need to be inserted in the plugin param
(this Common Event should trigger the pre-action phase)
-> ill attach some info screenshoots for this aswell
